\section{Introduction}

This document is a null content document that uses as many features of the
\LaTeX\index{LaTeX@\LaTeX} document processing system as possible.  It is not a test of \LaTeX\
typesetting so the content is not sophisticated, it is for testing the build capabilities of
\Waf.  So we use use index features to drive the use of makeindex and \BibTeX features so that
the \BibTeX system has to run.

This document is a grauitously multi-page document so that
cross-referencing\label{pg:first-page} can be tested, this will happen in Section~\ref{sec:xref}
on page~\pageref{sec:xref}.  There ought to be a reference to Section~4 on page~5.
